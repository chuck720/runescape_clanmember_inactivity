# ToDo
- ~~possibly adding classes to make clan members instances to minimize generated files~~
  - unnecessary
- [X] refactoring to OOP so you only have to run once
- [X] adding compare module to find inactives based on xp gained
- ~~move away from JSON and output CSV file to open in Excel~~
  - json is the best!
- ~~integrate with Google Sheets in some way through their API~~
  - API is read only :(
